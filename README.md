# Mustache shaving

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.8.

For a job recruting process, they asked me to create an interesting component in Angular 17. Since the theme of the other questions were around shaving the CEO's mustache, I used that as inspiration.

## Constraints

- Angular 17
- Only 1 component in 1 file

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
